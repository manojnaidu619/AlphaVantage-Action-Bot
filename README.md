## What Is it?

**AlphaVantage Action Bot** is a Github action that renders the realtime chart of a stock/cryptocurrency inside the readme file. We will be using the [Alpha Vantage Public Stock APIs](https://www.alphavantage.co/) to build the action bot. You may also check out [this finance API guide](https://medium.com/@patrick.collins_58673/stock-api-landscape-5c6e054ee631) that surveys some of the popular stock and crypto data APIs in the market.

## How to Setup?

This action could be adopted easily into your project in just 3 steps...

### *Step 1* - Adding script file into your repo.

This step is pretty simple, all you need to do is..
  - Create folder named `alphavantage` in the root of your repo.
  - Inside `alphavantage` folder, add a new python script file with name `alphavantage-bot.py` and paste the complete code below
  - [Link to Gist](https://gist.github.com/manojnaidu619/61809a103180f12a441d6de991b40a04 )

  - From line 8-50, the variables could be customized to requirements.
  
  > So now, your repo will contain a python script file, whose path is `YOUR_REPO_NAME/alphavantage/alphavantage-bot.py`. It should look like this...

### *Step 2* - Adding AlphaVantage API key to repo secrets.

- Since we are using [AlphaVantage's](https://www.alphavantage.co/documentation/) API to get the data, we need to obtain API key from them to utilize their service. [Click here to get API key](https://www.alphavantage.co/support/#api-key).

After filling the basic details, you should get your API key instantly.

### *Step 3* - Setup Workflow file(Final step, yay!).

Paste the below code inside
`REPO_ROOT/.github/workflows/AlphaVantage-Action-Bot.yml`
 
```yml

name: AlphaVantage-Action-Bot

on:
  schedule:
    - cron: "*/30 * * * *"  
    # Runs every 30th minute
    # Could be customized to requirement
    # To know more about crontabs refer https://crontab.guru/ 
     

jobs:
  alphavantage-render-chart:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: checkout repo content
        uses: actions/checkout@v2 # checkout the repository content to github runner.
      - name: setup python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v2
        with:
           python-version: 3.8 #install the python needed
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: python -m pip install --upgrade pip matplotlib pandas alpha_vantage
      - name: execute python script 
        run: python ./alphavantage/alphavantage-bot.py
        env:
           ALPHA_VANTAGE_KEY: ${{ secrets.ALPHA_VANTAGE_KEY }}
      - name: Commit and push if changed
        run: |
         git add .
         git diff
         git config --global user.email "alphavantage-action-bot@example.com"
         git config --global user.name "AlphaVantage Action Bot"
         git commit -m "AlphaVantage Action Bot Updated README" -a || echo "No changes to commit"
         git push
```
